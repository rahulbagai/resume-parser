# PyPI Release Workflow Template
#
# Copy this file to each target repository as: .github/workflows/pypi_release.yml
# This handles automated releases to PyPI when a new tag is created
#
# Setup required:
# 1. Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing at: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
# 2. Or add PYPI_TOKEN secret to repository
#
# Usage:
# - Push a version tag (e.g., v0.1.0) to trigger release
# - Or manually trigger via Actions UI for TestPyPI
